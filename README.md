## What's discord.fclang?
This library is a reskin of [discord.bat](https://github.com/mininmobile/discord.bat) and it is also re-written in FreakC. 

## Why discord.fclang?
Because I'm an idiot who found [discord.bat](https://github.com/mininmobile/discord.bat) online.

## [How to use?](Tutorial.md)

If you love FreakC (or me), please leave a star at [the FreakC's language repo](https://github.com/FreakC-Foundation/FreakC) and this repo too.
